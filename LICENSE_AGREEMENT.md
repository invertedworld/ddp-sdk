## 2. Grant of License

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Licensor grants Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to:

(a) Use the SDK in accordance with the documentation;

(b) Integrate the SDK into Licensee’s software products and services;

(c) Distribute the SDK as embedded in or alongside Licensee’s Licensed Software, provided that such distribution complies with this Agreement.

The license may be perpetual or for a defined period, as set out in the commercial agreement between the parties. The license is limited to the number of API keys issued by Licensor to Licensee. Each API key authorizes use of the SDK as documented. Licensee shall not exceed authorized usage.

**Developer use.** Notwithstanding the above, Licensor permits use of an API key for learning, development, and testing purposes only, by a single person, under the terms of this license. Such use is for development purposes and must not be used for production, distribution, or any commercial purpose. The API key must be treated as a secret and shall not be shared or disclosed.

---

## 3. Restrictions

Licensee shall not, and shall not permit any third party to:

(a) Reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code of the SDK, except to the extent permitted by applicable law;

(b) Remove, alter, or obscure any proprietary notices on the SDK;

(c) Sublicense, sell, lease, or transfer the SDK or any rights under this Agreement without Licensor’s prior written consent;

(d) Use the SDK for any unlawful purpose;

(e) Circumvent, disable, or tamper with any license key, API key validation, or other technical protection measures.

## 4. DDP Trademark and Attribution

Licensee acknowledges that DDP® is a trademark of DCA, Inc., and that DDP and the DDP mark are owned by DCA, Inc. Use of DDP is subject to DCA, Inc.’s trademark and attribution requirements.

As a condition of using the SDK to process DDP, Licensee shall comply with DCA, Inc.’s attribution requirements. Licensee shall include the DDP Logo and the DDP Trademark Text in any Licensed Software that Licensee distributes or makes available to third parties, in accordance with DCA, Inc.’s requirements.

The DDP Logo is provided in this distribution at `assets/ddp.png` for Licensee’s convenience. Licensor licenses the SDK; DCA, Inc. owns DDP and its mark. Licensee’s use of the SDK to handle DDP requires Licensee to comply with DCA, Inc.’s rules independently. This Agreement does not convey any rights in DCA, Inc.’s trademarks.

## 5. API Key and Confidentiality

The API key provided by Licensor is confidential and for Licensee’s use only. Licensee shall keep the API key secure and shall not disclose it to unauthorized third parties. Licensee may embed the API key in software deployed for Licensee’s own use, but shall take reasonable measures to protect it from exposure. Any disclosure of the API key must be reported urgently to the Licensor.

## 6. Support and Updates

Support and updates are provided (or not) as specified in a separate support agreement or as otherwise communicated by Licensor. This Agreement does not obligate Licensor to provide support, updates, or maintenance.

---

## 7. Term and Termination

This Agreement is effective upon acceptance (e.g., by signing, by use of the SDK, or as otherwise agreed) and continues until terminated.

Licensor may terminate this Agreement immediately upon breach by Licensee, or upon thirty (30) days’ written notice for any reason. Upon termination, Licensee shall cease use of the SDK and any API keys. Expiration or revocation of an API key terminates the license for that key. Sections 8, 9, 10, and 11 survive termination.

---

## 8. Warranty Disclaimer

THE SDK IS PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. LICENSOR DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SDK WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OF THE SDK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. LICENSOR’S TOTAL LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY LICENSEE TO LICENSOR IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM (OR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS USD, IF GREATER).

## 10. Indemnification

Licensee shall indemnify and hold harmless Licensor from any claims, damages, losses, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from Licensee’s use of the SDK, Licensee’s Licensed Software, or Licensee’s breach of this Agreement.

---
